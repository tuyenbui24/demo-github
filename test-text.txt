After 40 years, he passed away, and left her a letter which said: 

“My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my life’s lie. 

This was the only lie I said to you – the salty coffee. 

Remember the first time we dated?

I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt, it was hard for me to change so I just went ahead. 

I never thought that would be the start of my biggest lie. 

I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to, as I had promised never to lie to you. 

Now I’m dying, and afraid of nothing so I will tell you the truth: I don’t like salty coffee, what a strange bad taste!

But I have had salty coffee for my whole life.

Since I have known you, I have never felt sorry for anything I have done for you. 

Having you with me is the biggest happiness of my life.

If I could live again, I would want to know you and have you for my whole life, even if I had to drink the salty coffee again.”

Her tears made the letter totally wet.

Some day, someone asked her: “How does salty coffee taste?” “It’s sweet,” she replied.
